## Updates (Recent at top)
### Update v1.2.2
- Before noting what is in this update, I should let you know that this version doesn't actually change the functionality, but makes the coffee machine into a class object. This allows for greater flexibility and this to be imported into other projects, such as a restaurant project I might start working on. This is why I made it a major update.
